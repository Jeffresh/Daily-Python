# CHALLENGE!
#Use a dictionary comprehension to count the length of each word in a sentence.

sentence = "All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost"


#For all the numbers 1-1000, use a nested list/dictionary comprehension to
#find the highest single digit any of the numbers is divisible by.
