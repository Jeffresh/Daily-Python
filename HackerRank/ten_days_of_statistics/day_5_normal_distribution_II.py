# Task

# The final grades for a Physics exam taken by a large group of students have a mean 70 of
# and a standard deviation of 10
#
# If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal distribution, what percentage of the students:
#
# 1. Scored higher than 80
# 2. Passed the test ( grade >= 60)
# 3. Failed the test ( grade < 60)
#
# Find and print the answer to each question on a new line, rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
