# Task A large elevator can transport a maximum 9800 of pounds. Suppose a load of cargo containing 49 boxes must be
# transported via the elevator. The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of pounds 205
# and a standard deviation of 15 pounds. Based on this information, what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be
# safely loaded into the freight elevator and transported?
